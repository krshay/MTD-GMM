We study the multi-target detection problem of recovering a target signal from a noisy measurement that contains multiple copies of the signal at unknown locations. Motivated by the structure reconstruction problem in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we focus on the high noise regime, where the noise hampers accurate detection of the signal occurrences. We develop a generalized autocorrelation analysis framework to estimate the signal directly from the measurement. We demonstrate signal recovery from highly noisy measurements, and and show that the suggested framework outperform the classical autocorrelation analysis in a wide range of parameters.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
We study the multi-target detection (MTD) problem of estimating a target signal~$x \in \mathbb{R}^L$ from a noisy measurement that contains multiple copies of the signal, each randomly translated~\cite{bendory2019multi}, \cite{lan2020multi}, \cite{marshall2020image}, \cite{bendory2021multi}, \cite{kreymer2021two}, \cite{bendory2018toward}. Specifically, let~$y \in \mathbb{R}^N$ be a measurement of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:model}
y[\ell] = \sum_{i=1}^{p} x[\ell - \ell_i] + \varepsilon[\ell],
\end{equation}
where \mbox{$\{\ell_i\}_{i=1}^{p} \in \{L + 1, \ldots, N-L\}$} are arbitrary translations, and~$\varepsilon[\ell]\overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$. The translations and the number of occurrences of~$x$ in~$y$,~$p$, are unknown, and we assume~$L \ll N$. Figure~\ref{fig:measurements} presents examples of a measurement~$y$ at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We define~\mbox{$\text{SNR} := \frac{\|x\|_2^2}{L \sigma^2}$}.

In this work, our goal is to estimate the target signal directly from~$y$. We focus on the low SNR regime~(e.g., panel~(c)) in which the signal occurrences are swamped by the noise, and the locations of the signal occurrences cannot be reliably detected.}

\end{figure*}

The MTD model serves as a mathematical abstraction of the cryo-electron microscopy~(\mbox{cryo-EM}) technology for macromolecular structure determination~\cite{henderson1995potential},~\cite{nogales2016development},~\cite{bai2015cryo}. In a \mbox{cryo-EM} experiment \cite{frank2006three}, biological macromolecules suspended in a liquid solution are rapidly frozen into a thin ice layer. An electron beam then passes through the sample, and a two-dimensional tomographic projection is recorded. Importantly, the \mbox{2-D} location and \mbox{3-D} orientation of particles within the ice are random and unknown. This measurement is further affected by high noise levels and the optical configuration of the microscope.

In the current analysis workflow of \mbox{cryo-EM} data \cite{bendory2020single}, \cite{scheres2012relion}, \cite{punjani2017cryosparc}, the~\mbox{2-D} projections are first detected and extracted from the micrograph, and later rotationally and translationally aligned to reconstruct the~\mbox{3-D} molecular structure. This approach fails for small molecules, which induce low contrast, and thus low SNR. This makes them difficult to detect and align~\cite{bendory2018toward}, \cite{henderson1995potential}, \cite{aguerrebere2016fundamental}, rendering current \mbox{cryo-EM} algorithmic pipeline ineffective. For example, in the limit~\mbox{$\text{SNR} \rightarrow 0$}, reliable detection of signals' locations within the measurement is impossible~\cite[Proposition~3.1]{bendory2018toward}.

The MTD model was devised in \cite{bendory2018toward} in order to study the recovery of small molecules directly from the micrograph, below the current detection limit of \mbox{cryo-EM}~\cite{henderson1995potential},~\cite{d2021current}. An autocorrelation analysis technique (see Section~\ref{subsec:ac}) was implemented to recover \mbox{low-resolution}~\mbox{3-D} structures from noiseless simulated data under a simplified model. Autocorrelation analysis consists of finding a signal that best explains the empirical autocorrelations of the measurement, for example by minimizing a {least-squares} (LS) objective~(see Section~\ref{subsec:sig_recovery}). For any noise level, those autocorrelations can be estimated to any desired accuracy for sufficiently large~$N$. Computing the autocorrelations is straightforward and requires only one pass over the data, which is advantageous for massively large datasets, such as \mbox{cryo-EM} datasets~\cite{bendory2020single}.

Autocorrelation analysis is a special case of the method of moment, which is a classical statistical inference technique, tracing back to 1894~\cite{pearson1894contributions}. This work studies the application of the generalized method of moments~\cite{Hansen1982}, or, more precisely, the \textit{generalized autocorrelation analysis}, to the MTD problem. In the classical autocorrelation analysis, we wish to find a signal whose autocorrelations match the observed autocorrelations. This is usually done by minimizing a LS objective. The generalized autocorrelation analysis suggests replacing the LS objective with a weighted LS, and provides a recipe of how to compute the optimal weights; see Section~\ref{subsec:generalized_ac}. The generalized method of moments has been proven to be highly effective in a variety of computational task, such as \textbf{Asaf, I guess you know what Tamir means here} [] % Add references from the economics literature
We also mention that the framework can be formulated with other objective functions, rather than LS \textbf{and here.} [REF].

The main contribution of this paper is extending the autocorrelation analysis framework introduced in~\cite{bendory2019multi} by developing a generalized autocorrelation analysis framework for the one-dimensional MTD problem. We devise an algorithm for the recovery of the target signal from a measurement, and demonstrate a successful reconstruction in noisy regimes~(see Section~\ref{sec:numerical}). Moreover, we show that the generalized autocorrelation analysis estimator outperforms the classical estimator in different SNRs and measurement's lengths (see Section~\ref{sec:numerical}). It is thus a first step towards applying the generalized method of moments to recovering small molecules from \mbox{cryo-EM} micrographs~\cite{bendory2018toward}.

\section{Computational framework}
\label{sec:math}
\subsection{Autocorrelation analysis}
\label{subsec:ac}
The autocorrelation of order~$q$ of a signal~\mbox{$z \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$} is defined as
\begin{equation}
A_z^q[\ell_1, \ldots, \ell_{q-1}] := \mathbb{E}_z\Big[\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in \mathbb{Z}} z[i] z[i + \ell_1] \cdots z[i + \ell_{q-1}]\Big],
\end{equation}
where~$\ell_1, \ldots, \ell_{q-1}$ are integer shifts. Indexing out of bounds is zero-padded, that is,~\mbox{$z[i] = 0$} out of the range~\mbox{$\{0, \ldots, {N-1}\}$}. In this work, we use the first three autocorrelations. As~$N$ grows indefinitely, the empirical autocorrelations of~$z$ almost surely (a.s.) converge to the population autocorrelations of~$z$:
\begin{equation}
\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in \mathbb{Z}^2} z[i] z[i + \ell_1] \cdots z[i + \ell_{q-1}] \stackrel{\text{a.s.}}{=}A_z^q[\ell_1, \ldots, \ell_{q-1}],
\end{equation}
by the law of large numbers.

Our goal is to relate the autocorrelations of the measurement~$y$ with the target signal~$x$. In particular, the first-order autocorrelation is defined as
\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:AM1}
A_{y}^1 := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in \mathbb{Z}} y[i],
\end{equation}
which is just the mean of the measurement. The second-order autocorrelation of~$y$, \mbox{$A_{y}^2: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$}, is defined by
\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:AM2}
A_{y}^2 [\ell_1] := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in \mathbb{Z}} y[i] y[i + \ell_1],
\end{equation}
and the third-order autocorrelation~\mbox{$A_{y}^3: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$} by
\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:AM3}
A_{y}^3 [\ell_1, \ell_2] := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in \mathbb{Z}} y[i] y[i + \ell_1] y[i + \ell_2].
\end{equation}


\subsection{Autocorrelations under the well-separated model}
\label{subsec:relations}
We discuss the \mbox{well-separated} case of the MTD problem, which was studied in~\cite{bendory2019multi}. In this case, we assume that each signal in the measurement~$y$ is separated by at least a full signal length from its neighbors. Specifically, we assume that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sep}
|\ell_{i_1} - \ell_{i_2}| \ge 2L - 1, \quad \text{ for all } i_1 \ne i_2.
\end{equation}
Importantly, under the well-separated case, for shifts in the range \mbox{$\mathcal{L} = \{0, \ldots, {L - 1}\}$}, any given occurrence of~$x$ in~$y$ is only ever correlated with itself, and never with another occurrence.

In~\cite{bendory2019multi}, it was shown that under the well-separated condition~(\ref{eq:sep}), for any fixed level of noise~$\sigma^2$, density~$\gamma$ and signal length~$L$, in the limit~\mbox{$N \rightarrow \infty$}, the autocorrelations of the measurements are equal, possibly up to some bias terms, to the autocorrelations of the signal times a density constant. Specifically, we have that
\begin{align}
%\label{eq:well_separated_1st}
A_{y}^1 &\stackrel{\text{a.s.}}{=} \gamma A_{x}^1, \\
%\label{eq:well_separated_2nd}
A_{y}^2 [\ell_1] &\stackrel{\text{a.s.}}{=} \gamma A_{x}^2 [\ell_1] + \sigma^2\delta[\ell_1], \\
%\label{eq:well_separated_3rd}
A_{y}^3 [\ell_1, \ell_2] &\stackrel{\text{a.s.}}{=} \gamma A_{x}^3 [\ell_1, \ell_2] \nonumber \\&+ \gamma A_{x}^1 \sigma^2 (\delta[\ell_1] + \delta[\ell_2] + \delta[\ell_1 - \ell_2]),
\end{align}
for~$\ell_1, \ell_2 \in \mathcal{L}$, where
\begin{equation*}
\delta[\ell] = \begin{cases} 1 \text{ if } \ell = \vec{0}, \\ 0 \text{ otherwise}, \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
is the Kronecker delta function. Here,~$\gamma$ is the density of the target images in the measurement and is defined by
\begin{equation}
\gamma = p \frac{L}{N}.
\end{equation}

Notably, the relations between the autocorrelations of~$y$ and~$x$ do not directly depend on the location of individual signal occurrences in the measurement, but only through the density parameter~$\gamma$. Therefore, detecting the signal occurrences is not a prerequisite for signal recovery, and thus signal recovery is possible even in very low SNR regimes.

\subsection{Signal recovery from autocorrelations}
\label{subsec:sig_recovery}
Following~\cite{bendory2019multi}, \cite{lan2020multi}, \cite{marshall2020image}, \cite{bendory2021multi}, \cite{kreymer2021two}, and based on the notations presented above, we formulate a non-convex least squares problem for estimating the signal~$x$ from the autocorrelations of the measurement~$y$:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:optimization}
\min_{x, \gamma > 0} &w_1 (A_y^1 - \gamma A_x^1)^2 \nonumber\\ +& w_2 \sum_{\ell_1 = 0}^{L - 1} \|A_y^2[\ell_1] - \gamma A_x^2[\ell_1] - \sigma^2 \delta[\ell_1]\|_2^2\nonumber\\ +& w_3 \sum_{\ell_1 = 0}^{L - 1} \sum_{\ell_2 = 0}^{L - 1} \|A_y^3[\ell_1, \ell-2] - \gamma A_x^3[\ell_1, \ell_2] \nonumber\\ -& \gamma A_{x}^1 \sigma^2 (\delta[\ell_1] + \delta[\ell_2] + \delta[\ell_1 - \ell_2])\|_2^2,
\end{align}
where the weights were chosen such that each term is equally weighted, as suggested by~\cite{bendory2019multi}. This LS estimator serves as a benchmark for the generalized autocorrelation analysis estimator.

\subsection{The generalizes autocorrelation analysis}
\label{subsec:generalized_ac}
\subsubsection{The generalized autocorrelation analysis framework}
\label{gmm:framwork}
In its most simplified form, the generalized autocorrelation analysis generalizes~(\ref{eq:optimization}) by replacing the LS objective function with specific optimal weights. This choice guarantees favorable asymptotic statistical properties, such as {the} minimal asymptotic variance of the estimation error.

Let us define the \textit{moment function},~\mbox{$f(\theta, y)\colon \Theta \times \R^r \to \R^q$}. The moment function is chosen such that its expectation value is zero only at a single point~$\theta=\theta_0$, where~$\theta_0$ is the ground truth parameter set. Namely,
\begin{equation}\label{Eq-GMM-1}
	\E\left[f(\theta,y)\right] = 0 \quad \text{if and only if} \quad \theta = \theta_0.
\end{equation}
The moment function must satisfy this uniqueness condition~\eqref{Eq-GMM-1} and a few additional regularity conditions (which can be found in~\cite{Hansen1982}, \cite{Hall2005} \cite{abas2021generalized}). This flexibility enables the framework to be applied to a wide range of problems, such as subspace estimation~\cite{fan2018optimal}.

In order to define the moment function for the MTD problem, we first define the $i$-th observation from the measurement~$y$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
	y_i := [y[i],\ldots, y[i+L]].
\end{equation}
This choice of the moment function~$f(\theta, y)$ must fulfill~\eqref{Eq-GMM-1} using the defined samples~$y_i$. The natural choice of ~$f(\cdot)$ is
\begin{multline} \label{Eq-GMM-2}
	f(\theta, y_i) := \\
	\begin{bmatrix}
		&\gamma A_x^1 - A_{y_i}^1\\
		&\left\{\gamma A_x^2[\ell_1] + \sigma^2 \delta[\ell_1] - A_{y_i}^2 [\ell_1]\right\}_{\ell_1 =0}^{L-1} \\
		&\left\{\gamma A_x^3[\ell_1, \ell_2] + \gamma B(x, \ell_1, \ell_2) - A_{y_i}^3[\ell_1, \ell_2]\right\}_{\ell_1, \ell_2 = 0}^{L-1}
	\end{bmatrix},
\end{multline}
where~$B(x, \ell_1, \ell_2) := A_{x}^1 \sigma^2 (\delta[\ell_1] + \delta[\ell_2] + \delta[\ell_1 - \ell_2])$, and~$\theta := [x, \gamma]$. The estimated sample moment function is the average of~$f$ over~$N$ observations:
\begin{equation}\label{Eq-2-5}
	g_N(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 0}^{N - 1} f(\theta, y_i).
\end{equation}
The GMM estimator is defined as the minimizer of the weighted LS expression
\begin{equation} \label{Eq-2-1}
	\hat{\theta}_N = \arg\min_{\theta \in \Theta} \ g_N(\theta)^T W_N g_N(\theta).
\end{equation}
Here, $W_N$ is a fixed positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix. Note that the LS estimator~(\ref{eq:optimization}) is a special case of~(\ref{Eq-2-1}), where~$W_N$ is the identity matrix.

\subsubsection{Large sample properties}
\label{gmm:large}
Before presenting the statistical properties of the GMM, we fix notation. We denote by $\overset{p}{\to}$ and $\overset{d}{\to}$ convergence in  probability and in distribution, respectively. Let
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:cov_mat_S}
	S := \lim_{N\to \infty}\Cov\left[\sqrt{N}g_N(\theta_0)\right],
\end{equation}
be the covariance matrix of the estimated sample moment function~(\ref{Eq-2-5}) at the ground truth~$\theta_0$. We denote by $\{W_N\}_{N=1}^\infty$ a sequence of PSD matrices which converges almost surely to a positive definite matrix~$W$. Finally, the expectation of the Jacobian of the moment function at the ground truth~$\theta_0$ is denoted by $G_0 = \E\left[\partial f(\theta_0, y) / \partial \theta^T\right]$.

The large sample properties of the GMM estimator were derived in~\cite{Hansen1982}, and are presented in the following theorem. The regularity conditions for this theorem can be found in~\cite{Hansen1982}, \cite{Hall2005}, \cite{abas2021generalized}.

\begin{theorem}\label{Thm-2-6}
	Under {the} regularity conditions, the GMM estimator satisfies:
	\begin{enumerate}[label={\Alph*}.]
		\item  \label{Thm-2-2}
		\textnormal{(Consistency)} $\hat{\theta}_N \overset{p}{\to} \theta_0$.

		\item \label{Thm-2-3} \textnormal{(Asymptotic normality)}
		\[\sqrt{N} ( \hat{\theta}_N - \theta_0) \overset{d}{\to} \mathcal{N}(0, M S M^T ),\] where $M =[G_0^T W  G_0]^{-1} G_0^T  W$.

		\item \label{Thm-2-5} \textnormal{(Optimal choice of a weighting matrix)} The minimum asymptotic variance of $\hat{\theta}_N$ is given by $(G_0^T S^{-1} G_0)^{-1}$ and is attained by $W = S^{-1}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
Theorem~\ref{Thm-2-6} provides a matrix~$W$ {that} guarantees a minimal asymptotic variance of the estimator’s error. The covariance matrix~$S$ {of~(\ref{eqn:cov_mat_S}), which plays a central role in Theorem~\ref{Thm-2-6},} is required to be a positive definite matrix. Therefore, the moment function must be chosen so that~$S$ is full-rank. As in~\cite{abas2021generalized},  we remove the repeating entries of~$f$ (that appear due to the inherent symmetries of the autocorrelations). Moreover, in practice, the ground truth~$\theta_0$ is unknown a priori, so we cannot use the optimal weighting matrix. However, for our choice of the moment function~(\ref{Eq-GMM-2}), the matrix~$S$ is independent of the parameters of interest, and thus can be computed from the data:
	\begin{equation}\label{Eq-2-7}
		\Cov[g(\theta)] = \Cov\left[\left\{[A_{y_i}^1;\A_{y_i}^2;\A_{y_i}^3]\right\}_{i = 0}^{N - 1}\right].
	\end{equation}

\section{Numerical experiments}
\label{sec:numerical}
In this section, we present numerical comparisons for the estimators which were described in Section~\ref{sec:math}, the MoM and GMM estimators. The optimization problem~(\ref{eq:optimization}) was minimized using the~\mbox{Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno}~(BFGS) algorithm, while ignoring the positivity constraint on~$\gamma$ (namely, treating it as an unconstrained problem).  We measure the estimation error by
\begin{equation*}
\text{error}(x) = \frac{\|x - x^*\|_2}{\|x^*\|_2},
\end{equation*}
where~$x^*$ is the true signal, and~$x$ is the estimated signal. In each experiment, the measurements were generated according to~(\ref{eq:model}) with density~\mbox{$\gamma = 0.2$}, and the target signals~$x$ are of length~\mbox{$L = 21$}. We try to estimate the signal from~$5$ random initial guesses, and calculate the estimation error for the estimate whose final objective function is minimal. Then, we  calculate the median  error over 50 trials. The code to reproduce all experiments is publicly available at~\url{https://github.com/krshay/MTD-GMM}.


\subsection{Recovery error as a function of the measurement length}
\label{subsec:exp_size}
Figure~\ref{fig:err_size_experiment} presents recovery error as a function of the measurement size. We consider measurements with~\mbox{$\text{SNR} = 50$} in different lengths. As expected from the law of large numbers, both estimators' errors  decay as~$N^{-1/2}$, where~$N$ is the length of the measurement. In addition, for all measurements' lengths, the recovery error using the GMM is smaller than the error using the regular MoM estimator.
%In addition, Theorem~\ref{Thm-2-6} provides the optimality of the GMM estimator over the MoM estimator, and indeed the median error of the GMM estimator is smaller than the error of the MoM estimator for all sizes.

\label{fig:err_size_experiment}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Recovery error as a function of SNR}
Figure~\ref{fig:err_noise_experiment} presents recovery error as a function of SNR. We consider a fixed length of the measurements~$N = 10^6$. For all levels of SNR, the recovery error using the GMM is smaller than the error using the regular MoM estimator.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper is motivated by the effort of reconstructing small~\mbox{3-D} molecular structures using \mbox{cryo-EM}, below the current detection limit. The main contribution of this study is in extending the MoM framework developed in~\cite{bendory2019multi}, by introducing a GMM framework for the \mbox{1-D} case of the MTD problem, following the foundations laid in~\cite{abas2021generalized}. The optimality of the GMM framework was presented in Theorem~\ref{Thm-2-6}, and corroborated by numerical experiments.

Future work includes extending the GMM estimator to the~\mbox{2-D} and~\mbox{3-D} cases of the MTD problem. Furthermore, this work dealt only with the well-separated model of the MTD problem. Extending the GMM framework to the case of an arbitrary spacing distribution between signal and image occurrences~\cite{lan2020multi}, \cite{kreymer2021two}, constitutes another possible future work.
